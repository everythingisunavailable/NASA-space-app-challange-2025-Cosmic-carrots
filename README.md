# Clime Shuffle - NASA Space Spp Challenge

Clime Shuffle is a strategic, card-based farming game where players grow crops using real-world climate data. Players choose a crop and navigate monthly weather conditions, using action cards like Irrigation, Greenhouse, Fertilizer, and Shade Net to optimize growth. The game simulates crop growth using NASA climate datasets, creating a realistic and engaging challenge. Developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon.
