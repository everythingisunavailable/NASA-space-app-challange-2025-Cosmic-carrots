# Clime Shuffle - NASA Space App Challenge

Clime Shuffle is a strategic, card-based farming game where players grow crops using real-world climate data. Players choose a crop and navigate monthly weather conditions, using action cards like Irrigation, Greenhouse, Fertilizer, and Shade Net to optimize growth. The game simulates crop growth using NASA climate datasets, creating a realistic and engaging challenge. Developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon.

## Considerations
This project was done in one and a half days and the repository is messy because of github-pages asset connection failures. Thanks :) !
